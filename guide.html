    Retardbot Reborn is my epic Discord bot that does incredibly useless and somewhat useful tasks, and is indeed quite
    epic.<br>I don't know what else to put here so uhhhhh just keep scrolling down and check out the other webpages.
    Before you go down, make sure to read this "legend" to see where to go.<br><br>

<header style="color:white;font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;font: size 20">
    <b>Downloading the Code</b><br>
    Head on over to <a href="https://github.com/ah-yis/RetardBot">https://github.com/ah-yis/RetardBot</a><br>
    Click on the big green "Code" button, and select "Download ZIP"<br>
    Save it anywhere you want, and then extract it to its own folder.<br>
</header>
<br><br>

<header style="color:white;font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;font: size 20">
    <b>Downloading Dependencies</b><br>
    Just head over to <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download">https://nodejs.org/en/download</a> and grab the right
    installer.<br>
    There's some other things you'll need, like <a href="http://ffmpeg.org/download.html">FFMPEG</a>.
    I'm not sure how it's installed anywhere else, but Windows steps are provided.<br>
    Also, this isn't a dependency, but it is recommended to use something like Visual Studio Code to run the bot.<br>
    Also, you need to know beforehand how to make discord bot invite links, and you must have used
    <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started">this official guide</a>.<br>

    <b>Setting Up FFMPEG</b><br>
    After installing the binaries on Windows (i cant help you with anything else), you need to put them in a permanent
    folder somewhere.<br>
    Now open up Start and search up "View advanced system settings". Head on over to "Environment Variables" and find
    "Path" under
    "System variables".<br>
    Select "Edit...", click "New", and paste in the path of the folder with your FFMPEG binaries. This is important if
    you want to use voice channel
    stuff.

<header style="color:white;font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;font: size 20">
    <b>The Final Steps</b><br>
    Now, if you're using Visual Studio Code, all you have to do is press 'CTRL + K' and then immediately 'CTRL + L'.<br>
    Now, select the folder where you extracted all the code.<br>
    You are not done yet. Open up "main.js" and then, on (by default) line 14, enter your token into "client.login('');"
